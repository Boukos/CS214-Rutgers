"memory oriented"


types:
  structs
	- one new named type that consists of multiple other types
	- size? -> at least <- the sum of the size of its components
	
	
whence size? sizeof() !



char - 1 byte
sizeof(short) <= sizeof(int) <= sizeof(long)


	unions
	- one block of memory for all members
	- size is at least size of largest type
	- changing any one member will change all
