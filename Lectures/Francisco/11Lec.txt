Nonblocking calls (IO)
- returns even if the operation is not complete
- condition for return is often end of current timeslice
- often return a status value to indicate how much was completed

Blocking calls
- do not return until operation is done (period!)



Blocking IO:
good:
	- simpler code
	- simpler to reason about
bad:
	- if it breaks, you are broken (you lose control)
	- why actively wait? (you lose control)


Non-Blocking IO:
good:
	- if it breaks, meh (you regain control)
	- do not actively wait (you regain control)	
bad:
	- complex code
	- harder to reason about
