DS:
version control - 
distributed transactions:
A tomic: 2-phase locking/commit (maintain a rollback log)
C onsistent: ...  read/write quorums
I solated: 
D urable: 

Availability
Reliability
Scalability

mutiple copies:
A: check - likely to be one close/not in use
R: check - redundant is trivially reliable
S: ?  - depends - how are transactions managed?



presume 5 nodes:
Nw == 4
Nr == 2 

Nw == 5
Nr == 1

Nw == 2
Nr == 4


Physical Partitioning:
multiple distinct systems/subsystems/nodes
lack of global knowledge

failures:
Failstop
Crash
Byzantine

Parity Bit:
Even XOR Odd
- add a bit to make the sum of 1s in the data be even or odd (based on protocol)
