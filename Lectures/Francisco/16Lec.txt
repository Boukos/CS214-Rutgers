semaphore:

asychronous: insensitive to ordering of calls

threadsafe: insensitive to identity

why is this good for signal handlers?
signal handlers can run in any context at any time (between any instructions)
so ... anything that depends on running in a particular context or in a given order is not a good idea for a signal handler
