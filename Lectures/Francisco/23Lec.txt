variable length types:
0. delimiter - data continues until you find a control character
	benefit: just read until you find deimiter, then done with that segment (yay)
	pitfall: if your delimiter appears in your data, your protocol is BROKE (waaah)

1. header - state/control information first that changes interpretation of data afterward
	benefit: all state is known a-priori
	pitfall: can't adjust as you go/need to know all information at sender before you start

**always be careful that your state/metadata/header can not possibly be interpreted as data**
	
	

int written = write(fd, buf, 10);
//check for error and not done...
write(fd, buf+written, 10-written);

int array[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
int * p = array;
p[20] = 2;

Distributed Systems
- multiple cooperating subsystems bulit in such a manner so as to seem like one system

problem .. fault model

Failstop - system halts, and yells
Crash - system halts, and is quiet (silent failure)
Byzantine - sometimes exhibits arbitrary behavior

Fundamental issue ... lack of global knowledge
