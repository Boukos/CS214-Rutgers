Naming: semantic name -> IP address
IP lookup

routing: picking some series of links to move a resource from an arbitrary source to an arbitrary target node

P < NP < NPc

hop-by-hop (store and forward)

E-F


Networking layer:
- IP addresses
- concerned with routing
	-> figuring out which machine you are directly connected to to forward a message to to get it 'closer' to the target


DL layer:
- MAC address
- concerned with point-to-point communication
	-> manages the shared channel between this machine and another that it is directly connected to


PHY:
- modulate medium to physically represent information




Trans layer:
Sockets
1st end-to-end layer

Message goes in ...
- fragment message and manage sending the fragments (packets)		\
- sequence numbering, ECC																	|

- reliable delivery(++)																					> TCP (packet data, connection-oriented)
- (re)ordering of packets																			|
- flow control																								|
- congestion control																					/


UDP
- Datagrams
- connectionless
