----------------DESCRIPTION--------------------
Here I wrote a little program to show you how to
write header files and how to include header files
and then use the function or variables from other
source file.

Put all the files under the same directory and then
run the script. If script is not a executable file,
you can do "chmod +x ./script" and then run the script.
Then you can see some outputs.

I recommend you to do other experiments to test what 
I talked in the recitation. It's fun!!
