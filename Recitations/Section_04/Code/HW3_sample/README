------------------ README ------------------------

In the HW3_sample.c, there are 4 different experiments. You can remove the comment from the experiment you want to do and comment the rest. For experiment 1 and 2, you do not need to provide any input. For experiment 3 and 4, you need to provide input as follow:
e.g.
./sample "Original text" "text" "string" (experiment 3)

That means your original string is "Original text" and you want to replace "text" with "string". 

To compile the program, please do:
gcc -o test HW3_sample.c -g -std=c99

Then run:
./test (experiment 1 or 2)
	or
./test "string from" "from" "to" (experiment 3)
    or
./test "first string " "second string" (experiment 4)
